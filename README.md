# Store-Sales-Dataset-Analysis-

## 📌 Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive sales performance analysis for a retail store using real-world data. It focuses on customer behavior, product trends, regional performance, and shipping efficiency. By leveraging Power BI and Python, we built an insightful, interactive dashboard that empowers managers and analysts to make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
Analyze sales across product categories, regions, and customer segments.

Identify top-performing products and customers.

Evaluate shipping methods and their effect on customer satisfaction.

Uncover trends in monthly and geographic sales.

Provide actionable recommendations to optimize store performance.
